# CS-300-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
  I was tasked to solve analysis of the run-time and memory usage for data structures.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
  I approached the problem by preplanning ducments such as a flowchart, pseudocode, trell board and having the C++ documentation as reference. This allowed me to have all the resource I would need to solve this issue.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
  My preplanning allowed me to overcome any and all obstacles I had during this task. Esepciall the C++ documentation, it drastically increased my understanding of the langauge so that I could best use it to solve the task at hand.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
  Planning ahead will get you to success. This has been the greatest tool as Software Engineer for solving problems. A well thought out plan will always find success.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
  I'll come back to preplanning once more; it is an invaludable resource for layingout a solution to a problem. This solution is than converted into code.
